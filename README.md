## Project assumptions:

As a team we created an app with Frontend part based on React and Firebase Backend. Thanks to Firebase we created user (with email/passwort authentication), groups, exercises and activities collections. We also using Firebase storage to upload images.

## Development:

The app uses standard setup of create-react-app. To standarize how the code is written we used eslint (with extended airbnb rules) and prettier. You will also need to setup you own Firebase app (Firestore, Authentication and Storge).

## Production setup and deployment:

Live demo: [MoveUs](https://vera98d.github.io/TravelApp/)

For deployment we are using github workflows. After merge to master application is deployed to github pages. We also have workflow for application tests - merge is not possible if tests fail.

## Setup:

To run application you have to install dependencies by running `npm install` and then run project by `npm start` command.
